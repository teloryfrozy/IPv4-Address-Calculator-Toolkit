# IPv4 Address Calculator and Tools 📡

A versatile IPv4 address calculator and toolset implemented in C. This project aims to provide essential functionalities for working with IPv4 addresses. Whether you're a network technician looking for quick information or a developer wanting to integrate IP address handling into your software or application, this tool can help.

## Features 🔧

✨ **Get Broadcast Address** 📢 - Calculate and retrieve the broadcast address for an IPv4 address and prefix.

✨ **Get Network Address** 🌐 - Determine and fetch the network address for a given IPv4 address and prefix.

✨ **Get Number of Available IP Addresses** 💡 - Find out the number of available IP addresses within a given network.

✨ **Get Subnet Mask** 🎭 - Get the subnet mask for a specified IPv4 address and prefix.

✨ **Check Validity of IP Address** ✅ - Verify the validity of an IPv4 address, ensuring it's neither the broadcast nor network address.

## Usage 🚀

This IPv4 Address Calculator and Tools project is designed to be a valuable resource for technicians and developers alike. You can use it for quick IP address calculations directly from the command line. However, for a more user-friendly experience, consider implementing these functionalities within your software or application.

### Challenge: Translating Python to C 🤖

This project started as a Python script and was later translated into C. The challenge was to maintain the functionality while adapting to C's syntax and structure. The resulting tool offers the same features as the original Python version.

Feel free to explore the code to see how IPv4 address manipulation and calculations are done in both Python and C.
